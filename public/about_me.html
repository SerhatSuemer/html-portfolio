    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi, I'm Serhat Sümer,<br>
        and I’m currently retraining as an IT Specialist in Application Development.<br>
        For me, IT is more than just a job – I’m genuinely passionate about technology and love learning new things, especially when they spark my interest.<br>
        I’ve worked in different fields before, but I bring real-life experience, empathy, and strong motivation with me.<br>
        This portfolio is my way of showing who I am, what drives me, and what I’m currently working on.<br> Welcome to my journey into the world of software development!</p>
